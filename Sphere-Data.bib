abstract = "The Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) provided near-full-sky broadband visible-light photometric maps for 8.5 years from 2003 to 2011. At a cadence of typically 14 maps per day, these each have an angular resolution of about 0.5$^\circ$ and differential photometric stability of about 1\% throughout this time. When individual bright stars are removed from the maps and an empirical sidereal background subtracted, the residue is dominated by the zodiacal light. This sky coverage enables the formation of an empirical zodiacal-light model for observations at 1 AU which summarizes the SMEI data. When this is subtracted, analysis of the ensemble of residual sky maps sets upper limits of typically 1\% for potential secular change of the zodiacal light for each of nine chosen ecliptic sky locations. An overall long-term photometric stability of 0.25\% is certified by analysis of three stable sidereal objects. Averaging the nine ecliptic results together yields a 1-$$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.3\% for zodiacal light change over this 8.5 year period."

	abstract = {Artificial lights raise night sky luminance, creating the most visible effect of light pollution{\textemdash}artificial skyglow. Despite the increasing interest among scientists in fields such as ecology, astronomy, health care, and land-use planning, light pollution lacks a current quantification of its magnitude on a global scale. To overcome this, we present the world atlas of artificial sky luminance, computed with our light pollution propagation software using new high-resolution satellite data and new precision sky brightness measurements. This atlas shows that more than 80\% of the world and more than 99\% of the U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is hidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60\% of Europeans and nearly 80\% of North Americans. Moreover, 23\% of the world{\textquoteright}s land surfaces between 75{\textdegree}N and 60{\textdegree}S, 88\% of Europe, and almost half of the United States experience light-polluted nights.},

abstract = "The brightness of the moonless night sky above La Palma was measured on 427 CCD images taken with the Isaac Newton and Jacobus Kapteyn Telescopes on 63 nights during 1987–1996. The median sky brightness at high elevation, high galactic latitude and high ecliptic latitude, at sunspot minimum, is B = 22.7 mag arcsec−1, V = 21.9 mag arcsec−1, R = 21.0 mag arcsec−1, similar to that at other dark sites. The main contributions to sky brightness are airglow and zodiacal light. The sky is brighter at low ecliptic latitudes (by 0.4 mag), at solar maximum (by 0.4 mag), and at high airmass (0.25 mag brighter at airmass 1.5). Light pollution (line + continuum) contributes < 0.03 mag in U, ≈0.02 mag in B, ≈0.10 mag in V, ≈0.10 mag in R at the zenith. This paper is a summary of results which are presented in full elsewhere (Benn & Ellison, 1998)[La Palma Technical Note 115]."
